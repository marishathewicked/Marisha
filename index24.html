Friendship plays a significant role in any human life. Man is a social being. Our inwardness demands of us to be close to the one with whom me are able to share joy and grief. We get married and have children. We all have relatives. Nevertheless it still can not substitute friends. Eventually, a friend is the person to whom you can complain about your family. Family and friends are similar, and still they are completely different. Family are the people who you see every day or, at least, once in two weeks, but, with a friend you can be separated for a month or two. And, after this time, in a meeting you feel like there was no separation at all. A friend is a special person in your life. Being a friend is a special responsibility. </p><p>
I met my best friend at the university. We lived in the same room for five years.  During that time, we got know each other very well. She's like a sister to me. We support each other in a way of life. I love her. We quarrel and make it up again. We've gone through so much together. We were hugging and crying when we parted after university. I still remember how we were talking at night.  </p><p>
The room is getting dark and familiar voice is speaking in silence: "Are you sleeping?".
 After that, we were discussing what was happening in our life that moment, about the future, about our hopes and fear. Sometimes we spent entire evening together. We cooked dinner and watched movies. Natasha plaited my hair and told me about everything. </p><p>
Also we didn't stop chatting after we dispersed to different cities after university. I remember that call when she said that she was getting married. Next she said that she is pregnant. One of the memorable high points in my life is when she showed me her newborn daughter from the window of her ward. Now I am godmother. I love those two girls. For me it is important that they have always been in my life, it doesn't matter where I am, and what happens. </p><p>
Friendship is when you forget about your problems if your friend is sad, when you try to give a very sound and profound advice. When you take honey and lemon and go to the sick friend. When you stand up in front of a huge bully who tries to offend your friend, without thinking about it. Friendship is like love is in simple things:  in a cup of tea, in a soft smile, in letters... in a small room with a wardrobe, two wooden beds, old table between them and roaring refrigerator. </p><p>
