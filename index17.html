Dear Mr. Gagarin, </p>
<p align="justify">
Further to my previously unanswered letter of November 12th. I wish to draw your attention to the unforgettable service I experienced during my recent stay at your hotel.</p>
<p align="justify">
I booked my room on October 31th 2015. I checked in the hotel at 8 p.m. </p>
<p align="justify" >
I would like to start by stating that the hotel’s staff is very friendly and professional. There was no a delay at registration. My luggage was taken to the room and manager led me toward my room. </p>
<p align="justify">
The room fitted the requirements except the color of curtains. I booked a room with dark curtains, because I can't fall asleep if the room is bright. The curtains were white in the room. I immediately pointed out that to manager. A stunning event happened next. Manager opened the door from the nightstand and pulled out a knife.  He cut his fingers very quickly and began to paint one of the curtains with his blood. I stopped this madness and turned manager out of the room.</p>
<p align="justify">
I found twenty knives of different sizes in the nightstand. I went to the shower. I was in the bathroom when I heard a noise. I carefully opened the door and saw a woman. She was pulling a young man by the leg in the middle of the room. He mumbled something but I couldn't hear. The woman stopped and leaned over him. He was very pale. Her dark long hair covered her face. She began scratching man's neck by her big nails. She was scratching until blood pulsed from his neck. She pressed her lips to his neck and began to drink his blood. I was so scared. So I carefully closed the door. I stayed in the bathroom for around an hour. When I opened the door again nobody was there. I went out to the hall. It was empty. I decided to wait till morning. I quickly closed the door and went to bed. I put one of the biggest knives under my pillow and fell asleep.</p>
<p align="justify">
When I opened my eyes next time I saw a huge wolf in front of my bed. He looked at me hungrily. I got scared. I pull out the knife from under the pillow. I sat at the head of the bed and stretched out my shaking hand with a knife to the front. The wolf's eyes narrowed. He grinned. I saw his huge fangs and my heart started beating quickend. Wolf was ready to attack me. I threw out the knife. A few minutes later the wolf stood stock-still. Then he hid his fangs and jumped on the bed. He lied at my feet. I was shocked. I found myself in reality ather a few minutes. I reached out my hand and tried to touch the wolf. He raised his head. I stayed put and then I continued reaching out my hand slowly towards his face. I was watching as the wolf was moving to me. I patted the wolf. His fur was soft and the skin was hot. I lied down and he got closer to me. I could feel his breathing. For the first time, I felt safe.</p>
<p align="justify">
Once again, I woke up because something cold had fallen on me. I opened my eyes and I saw the night sky overhead. Snow was falling from the sky. The room was full of light. I wanted to get out of bed but I noticed that the entire floor was burning with a steady flame. It was very scary but beautiful. The flames devoured the falling snow. It was very cold. I was alone in the burning room, the wolf had gone. The fire was only on the floor and it didn't spread. The flames was getting bigger and bigger.  Soon the fire became to grow in a figure. A dragon emerged from the flames and paced across the room. It was incredible. The fire dragon was flying under the snow in my room. The window was opened by a strong gust of wind and the dragon flew out of the room. The dragon was brighter than all the lights of the city. His powerful fiery wings carried him to the starry sky. The morning light came.</p>
<p align="justify">
In summary, it was a really strange and dangerous night. I would like to draw your attention to the safety in your hotel. First of all, when fire started the fire alarm didn't work. It's a gross violation of rules of fire safety. Secondly, I was the witness of a crime. I just request my wolf back to me. If you don't grant my request I shall be forced to call my solicitor. </p>
<p align="justify"> <br>
Looking forward to a speedy resolution.<br>
Yours faithfully. <br>
Marisha Wicked <br>

Dear Ms. Wicked, </p>
<p align="justify">
I am writing on behalf of Hotel “Gold Flamingo” in relation to your complaint. I was very concerned to learn about the problem experienced and the unprofessional conduct of our staff. Please accept my sincere apologies for everything the happened, and thank you for bringing it to my attention. We guarantee return of the wolf. Our best hunter was sent on a hunt. </p>
<p align="justify">
Nevertheless, do not worry, he will not cause harm to the wolf. Also the ravens searched in the small towns and adjacent regions. I have spoken to our staff regarding in incident and we are putting in place measure to make sure that in the future the staff will not eat in the rooms. The incident occurred in your room was due to an error in the database. The staff was incorrect thinking that the room is free. However, those responsible have punished already. We have also offered you a free week-long stay in a suite, at any time convenient for you, as a gesture of goodwill. Once again I hope you will accept my sincere apologies. If I can be of further assistance do not hesitate to contact me on my direct line given above. <br> </p>
<p>
<br>
Best regards,<br>
Yuri Gagarin <br>
