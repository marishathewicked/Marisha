 <p>
 A family of hares lived in a cozy little hole in a small old forest, at the foot of a high mountain. There was a father, a mother and their three children. The oldest boy was named Bravery, the middle girl - Geniality, and the youngest girl was named Hope. </p><p>
Every morning parents had to leave their children to look for some food. The forest is a dangerous place for small hares. The kids were always playing near their home. They loved to play hide and seek. Bravery was a very strong and fast hare. He was the oldest child of the great family and he always looked after his younger sisters. He had a small scar on his left ear. </p><p>
One day his sister Geniality got lost in woods. She was playing near hole and saw a small butterfly. It was so beautiful, admirable and inviting that Geniality could not take her eyes off its beauty. The butterfly was fluttering over her head. The sunlight was gleaming through its wings. Each sweep of the wings was like a breath of life. Big eyes of Geniality were following every motion of this miracle. Geniality didn't notice how she turned away from home. She was like being hypnotized. She was jumping after the butterfly wings until they got dark because of the absence of sunlight which was covered by huge trees in the deep forest. Geniality was very scared.  Geniality was jumping in circles to understand where she came from.  Fear was tight. It was filling her mind. She felt that someone was spying upon her from behind the centuries-old trees whose roots were so deep into the ground that no storm could disturb their peace. She nestled against the ground. Only the watchful ears could be seen over the grass. She heard how someone was approaching rapidly. Her heart was jumping out of her chest. She shut her eyes very tight.  </p><p>
- What are you doing here? - a familiar voice asked her, breathing heavily. </p><p>
She looked up and she saw her brother. One of his ears was bleeding. </p><p>
- I'm lost - she said apologetically. </p><p>
- Why are your ear bleeding? - she continued.  </p><p>
- I was looking for you and a dry branch hooked me - he answered. </p><p>
- I'm so sorry - she said. </p><p>
Geniality was looking at him with her big blue eyes. He could be cross with here. He loved her. </p><p>
- Let's go home, an unbelievable creature - he said smilingly. </p><p>
One day the kids stayed alone as usual and were playing near the hole. Geniality and Bravery were playing catch-up. They were so enthralled and they didn't notice as evening came. </p><p>
- Where is Hope? - Bravery asked. </p><p>
- I do not know - Geniality answered. </p><p>
Both started looking around. A stone fell out of the hole. They ran into the hole and they found their sister on the floor. She was shivering. </p><p>
- What happened? - mom asked entering the room. </p><p>
- Oh dear! - mom ran to the daughter. </p><p>
Bravery lifted his sister to carry her to bed. Blue berries came out of her foot. </p><p>
- No! - mom shouted. </p><p>
- It is poisonous berries - Geniality said anxiously. </p><p>
- What can we do? - Bravery asked. </p><p>
- I know only one antidote. Yellow flowers which grow under an old oak tree, behind a mountain. </p><p> Their roots kill the poison. Father will not be able to come home soon. He'll be back tomorrow. I have to go my dear. Take care of your sister until I get back. - mom explained. </p><p>
- I will go! I can handle it- Bravery said. </p><p>
- I'll help you - Geniality took it up. </p><p>
Mom looked at her children sadly and anxiously. </p><p>
- Be carefull, my dear- she said. </p><p>
Mom hugged the children and sat down beside the bed of the diseased daughter. </p><p>
The kids started their difficult dangerous way. The house was getting farther and the mountain was getting closer. The mountain was huge in comparison with their tiny bodies but it was so tiny compared with their burning hearts. The kids could overcome all obstacles. They jumped on cold stone of the mountain. They were climbing higher and higher. A few hours later, they felt cold snow under feet for the first time. The trail was getting more difficult to follow. They were walking in trail. The cold mountain always makes its own rules. It didn't care how the kids were going forward plunging deeper and deeper into snow. The sky was getting dark. The storm was slowly approaching the mountain. As soon as it had met the mountain the true madness started. It was as the wind, having broken its chain, was sweeping away everything. Snow was battering the greedy land. But the two small hares kept going ahead in spite of everything. </p><p>
- Go Geniality! We're getting close – Bravery shouted through storm. </p><p>
- We are close - Geniality quietly repeated for herself. </p><p>
It was hard to resist the wild wind. They were almost blind. The snowfall was heavy, that nothing could be seen. The storm was getting stronger every moment. It covered the whole mountain intoxicated by its power. But over time it lost its interest and began to fade. </p><p>
- We can do it - Bravery thought. </p><p>
It got quiet, but the snow kept falling. Two kids were walking in trail. Suddenly they heard a howl. It was a wolf who already had got desperate to find food. At this point, Geniality slipped. She rolled down. Bravery turned around and saw how his sister was heading down. He jumped after her. When he found her, she was lying on her hip. She pressed one of her legs to her chest. </p><p>
She looked at him. Pain and regret were in her eyes. She was silent. </p><p>
- Don't be afraid. Everything is ok  - Bravery was desperately trying to find a solution in his head. </p><p>
- You have to go further - Geniality said. </p><p>
- You know it – She continued. </p><p>
- I'm not going to leave you here - he said. </p><p>
- We have no choice - she said strainedly. </p><p>
- I saw a small cave nearby. I'll take you there. I will pick you on the way back. - he said. </p><p>
- We have no time - she begged. </p><p>
- The storm is over. I have time. Hang on!- he said. </p><p>
She wrapped her arm around his neck and he pulled her to the cave. His feet were delving deep into the snow but he was walking confidently toward the black cave.
The cave was very small and crude. Bravery put the sister gently on snow. </p><p>
- Is it hurt? - he asked. </p><p>
- No - she said, frowning with the pain. </p><p>
- Hold on. I'll be back soon - he said. </p><p>
He kissed her forehead and quickly jumped ahead. </p><p>
She was badly shivering and her eyes were full of tears. The darling shade was moving away from her. She closed her eyes. </p><p>
- I will be soon. I'll be back - he shouted, but she didn't hear him anymore. </p><p>
He was running as fast as his strength allowed. He didn't feel the cold snow underfoot. His body was burning. Soon he saw a big tree with pink leaves. It was incredibly beautiful. The snow emphasized the extraordinary beauty of the leaves. Bravery breathed with long breath. He ran toward the savior.  </p><p>
Suddenly the wolf appeared in front of him. He was thin and tired. He hadn't eaten probably for many days. His eyes were red and saliva was dripping from his mouth.
Bravery couldn't let down his family. He stood up on his back feet, raised his ears and looked right at the wolf.
The wolf was looking at the hare for a while and then he turned and walked away.
Bravery was visited by a faint sense of unreality. But there was no time to think. He immediately started jumping toward to the tree. 
Next moment, he was under the tree. There was nothing else under three at all except the white snow. He was startled and shook his head. </p><p>
-No. That can't be truth! - he said it to himself. </p><p>
 It was snowing there. The hare froze on the spot. Salty tears fell on snow.  </p><p>
 On the spur of the moment the hare started digging in snow. 
He was quickly digging with his paws deeper and deeper. He bumped into something solid. It was a small root. For a moment Bravery was just staring at the little thing on the ground. Then he took the root and jumped back to the mountain. 
Нe was working with all his power to get to the cave as soon as possible. </p><p>
- I'm here! I'm here! - he shouted. </p><p>
He was looking at the little body and jumping with all force to it. 
Geniality didn't move. He flew into the cave and began to shake her. </p><p>
- Wake up! Please, wake up! - he shouted. </p><p>
Her eyes were closed. Snow stuck in her hair. She was so cold. </p><p>
- Please don't leave me - he whispered. </p><p>
He stopped shaking sister. His legs were shaking. </p><p>
- I'm cold - she replied. </p><p>
- We need to go, love - he said quietly. </p><p>
For a moment he thought that she would never answer him. The fear took away his voice and now he could only whisper. The lump in his throat was sharp and cold as the walls of this cave. </p><p>
- Hope is waiting for us. She needs us. Please hold on to me. I'll take you home - he whispered. </p><p>
- I'm so cold - she repeated. </p><p>
- Please hold on to me. - he begged. </p><p>
Geniality enfolded his neck. He carried her out of the cave carefully. He was exhausted. His frozen sister lied on his shoulders and he carried magic root in his paws.
A few steps led them from home. </p><p>
- Look. We have come – he whispered. </p><p>
She looked up and saw parent's home. 
After a few minutes, the pair of warm darling paws were laying Geniality in her bed. Mom covered her with a blanket and started patting her on the head. Her eyes had gotten heavy and she fell asleep. </p><p>
She dreamed vivid dreams. She saw rosewood, herself, brother and sister. They were playing hide and seek under the tree and laughing. 
Geniality woke up. It was difficult to move. </p><p>
- Mom - she called. </p><p>
- Yes, darling! - Mom answered. </p><p>
- Where are Bravery and Hope? - Geniality asked. </p><p>
- They are well. Your brother has brought medicine. It worked. - mom said smilingly. </p><p>
A few days later the family had a great dinner. They were sitting around a table, eating, talking and laughing. It was one of the happiest nights of their lives.
