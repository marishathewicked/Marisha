You're not afraid of the dark and the creatures,<br>
Who live there, are you?<br>
I was afraid of dense dark, thick as fog, <br>
It calls to find its creatures inside.<br>
Follow me my friend. <br>
Let's turn off the lights and sit on the floor below the bed.<br>
Don't raise the curtains. They like night lights of a city.<br>
You have to steady your breath to not frighten them.<br>
Something is looking at you from a dark corner, between a wooden table and a gelid wall.<br>
Breathe evenly and hide your fear, as deep as you can.<br>
It is crawling cautiously...<br>
It is moving fast by spurts to you and it stops in front of you.<br>
It is laying down its huge claws on your knees.<br>
It is pulling the neck approaching your face.<br>
Empty eyes are looking at you with interest.<br>
It matters nothing to you.<br>
It sits next to you on the floor.<br>
The second creature is descending from another angle like a spider.<br>
It is more terrible and meaner than first.<br>
It is climbing onto the bed behind you.<br>
Don't turn around.<br>
You can feel like it is scanning you.<br>
Its head is at the same level as your shoulder.<br>
Its is trying to force you to turn your head and look at it.<br>
Everything freezes for a while.<br>
It is tired of waiting for your fear.<br>
It sits next to you.<br>
The piano is playing from the player.<br>
We like the sound of the piano.<br>
We like the light of the city at night from the window.<br>
...<br>
They're just shadows.<br>
They want to feel how their own fingers slide on their own hands.<br>
They want to feel.<br>
I close my eyes and I let the dark to find my fear to revive exhausteds.<br>
Now I am a shadow. They are alive.<br>
They are trying to destroy everything, <br>
As slaves of feelings which hit them as thousands of lightnings simultaneously.<br>
A glass vase with flowers felt down on the floor with the ringing sound.<br>
Water dabbled on my face, but I don't feel its cold and body.<br>
They're running around the room and scattering my notes about what I've been ever felt, and seen.<br>
They are tearing them to shreds.<br>
Earrings, rings and bracelets are falling silently on the soft carpet.<br>
The watch with a broken dial is still ticking.<br>
One of them froze over the heart-shaped pendant.<br>
It raised the ugly head and stared at me.<br>
I closed my eyes in assent. I allow them to do absolutely everything they want.<br>
It raised the sharp claw overhead and struck the pendant violently.<br>
The pendant is destroyed completely. It's a lost art.<br>
Feathers are flying around the room.<br>
Clothes, books, plush toys are scattered all over the room.<br>
Scratched walls endure everything.<br>
There is nothing more to destroy.<br>
Nothing remained in the room only three of us and music from the player.<br>
We like the sound of the piano.<br>
